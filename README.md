# Engine (I don't have a name yet)
<p>
A simple engine made in OpenGL with the sole purpose of teaching me how graphics and game programming works.
Some files used by IntelliJ IDEA are gitignored but it should be fairly straight forward to clone and build the project if you know what you're doing. I can't give any advice if you're using some other IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, that's up to you.
Java JDK is not included, but LWJGL is.

To run a client, it has to subclass EntryPoint and that subclass has to be set as Main class when running.
