# OpenGLGame
This is my first experience with OpenGL. I have no idea what this will unfold into, but I like just playing around with the API.
I don't recommend taking inspiration or getting help with your code here, as it isn't yet documented and I'm no expert Java programmer.
Though, this is how I chose to make use of OpenGL and it works. xD
