Some files used by IntelliJ IDEA are gitignored but it should be fairly straight forward to clone and build the project if you know what you're doing. I can't give any advice if you're using some other IDE than IntelliJ IDEA, that's up to you.
Java JDK is not included, but LWJGL is.

To run a client, it has to subclass EntryPoint and that subclass has to be set as Main class when running.
